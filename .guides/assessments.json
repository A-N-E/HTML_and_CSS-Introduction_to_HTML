This way you can be sure you have understood the idea first.\n\n- The tag for bold is `<b>` (don't forget the closing tag)\n- The tag for underlined is `<u>`\n- The tag for italic is `<i>`\n\n\n**Important** : if you want to preview your changes, press the Reload Preview button. \n\nWhen you're done, press the button below to check your code.",
