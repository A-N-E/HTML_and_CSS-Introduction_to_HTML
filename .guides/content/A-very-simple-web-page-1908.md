On the far left hand side is a so-called "file tree". This is where files are stored. We'll talk about this more soon.

You can see an opened file `index.html` on the left. What you are seeing is a very basic web page.

It looks a little scary with all those *tags* like `<html>` and `<body>` and so on. Don't worry, you'll soon get used to them. 

## The html element
This is the root or top-level element of the html document. It contains only two other elements `<head>` and `<body>`. The `<head>` is the part of the page which is not visible and gives *meta* information about the page, like the `<title>`,  which we will see later. The `<body>` is the main part of the page and will contain all the visible content of the page, text, images and more.

Another way of seeing the `index.html` document is :

<iframe  width="100%" height="55%" src="/visu/visu.html#url=/03-very-simple-page/index.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can see that the `<html>` `<head>` `<body>` `<title>` can be considered as "boxes" that contains what is inside them. We will come back to that soon.


## The Preview window
Below `index.html` is the 'Preview' window. This shows what happens when your browser runs the web page.

Go ahead and change the `Hello there!!!` text to something else. Next, press the 'Reload Preview' button in the preview window.

You should see your changes shown nicely.

When you are done playing with the text, we continue to the next section !
