You should now see a different web page on the left. Let's see what we've added.

## Tags we've used
- `<h1>Heading</h1>` gives you a level 1 heading. This is usually the largest one.
- `<h2>Smaller heading</h2>` gives you a level 2 heading. This is a bit smaller than the `<h1>`.
- `<p>Hello there!!!</p>` gives you a paragraph. 
- You'll notice that we have `... and goodbye` without any tags around it. In fact it does have tags around it! It is within the `<body>` tag! Putting text here is generally a bad idea (we'll explain another time) but it works.

## Comments
You might have seen at the end of the page :
`<!-- You can add anything you want here -->`

This a special (fake) tag that allows developer to leave comments to themselves or other people editing the page.
This won't display anything in the browser! It's just visible for people reading the source code.

## Change it
Feel free to go ahead and change the contents of the `index.html` file. Don't worry if you wreck it. 

For example, you could change the content inside the `<h1>Heading</h1>` to `<h1>A very nice heading</h1>` or you can add a paragraph after `<p>Hello there!!!</p>` but before `... and goodbye`
