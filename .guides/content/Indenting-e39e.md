One important habit to take is to nicely indent your code.

Take a look at the code on the left. Everything is on the same line. It's difficult to read and understand the structure of the page.

If we come back to our box analogy, indenting allow us to visually see the "boxes" in our code.

## How it should look
Below is the same code as you see on the left, but nicely indented. Notice how you can add extra line breaks to make things even clearer. This won't affect the way it appears when it runs.

Read the tips below then indent the code so it looks nice and tidy.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

  <head>
      <title></title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>Puppies and Kittens</h1>
    <p>Here is a cute picture.</p>
    <img src="cute.jpg" alt="A cute puppy and kitten.">
  </body> 
  
</html>
```

## How can you indent ?

- Put the cursor at the beggining of a line and press the space bar multiple times. It works but it's considered best practice and is not the fastest way.

- Another way is to put again your cursor at the begining of a line and press the tab key to indent. This is already better and at least when you use tab the indenting of all the lines match.

- Now the smartest way is to use Codio editor's Beautify feature. It will take your code and indent it for you!
Try using it on the example. Click `Tools > Beautify` when you have the focus on the code. If you don't select anything in the code it will Beautify all the code in the editor. If you select some lines it will just Beautify these lines.
