On the far left you can see the Filetree panel which shows all the files in your workspace.

The opened file `index.html` on the file contains code for a very basic web page. It looks a little scary with all those *tags* like `<html>` and `<body>` and so on. Don't worry, you'll soon get used to them. 

## The html element
This is the root or top-level element of the HTML document. It contains only two other elements `<head>` and `<body>`. The `<head>` is the part of the page which is not visible and gives *meta* information about the page, like the `<title>`, which is displayed on the browser tab. The `<body>` is the main part of the page and will contain all the visible content of the page, text, images and more.

We can visualise the `index.html` document as a nested tree of elements:

You can see that the `<html>` `<head>` `<body>` `<title>` can be considered as "boxes" that contains what is inside them. 

## The Preview window
Below the code windows is a 'Preview' window pointing to our simple web page. Go ahead and change the `Hello there!!!` text to something else. Next, press the 'Reload Preview' button in the preview window.

When you are done playing with the text, we continue to the next section !
