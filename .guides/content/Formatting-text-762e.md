# Bold, italic and underline

In the left pane you will see the code for another web page, as you see, all the text look the same.


|||challenge
Your job is to make the world 'bold' actually **bold**, the word 'underlined' <u>underlined</u> and 'italic' actually *italic*. It should look like this ...

The way you do this is to use tags to enclose the piece of text you want to change in order to get the right effect.

Here are some tips and clues

- Try just bold first before you do all 3. This way you can be sure you have understood the idea first.

- The tag for bold is `<b>` (don't forget the closing tag)
- The tag for underlined is `<u>`
- The tag for italic is `<i>`

# If you can't find it

Remember your box analogy ? We have to put the words "bold" "italic" "underlined" in boxes to tell the browser that it should display them differently.

Here is the structure of the document initially :

<iframe  width="100%" height="100%" src="https://fruit-active.codio.io/visu/visu.html#url=/07-formatting/index.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here is how it should look like :

<iframe  width="100%" height="100%" src="https://fruit-active.codio.io/visu/visu.html#url=/visu/07-formatting/result.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now use the `<b>` `<u>` `<i>` tags in the Codio editor on the left and <a href="#checkit">check it</a> again :)
