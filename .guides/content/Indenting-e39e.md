One important habit to take is to nicely indent your code.

Take a look at the code on the left. Everything is on the same line. It's difficult to read and understand the structure of the page.

If we come back to our box analogy, indenting allow us to visually see the "boxes" in our code.

## How it should look
Below is the same code as you see on the left, but nicely indented. Notice how you can add extra line breaks to make things even clearer. This won't affect the way it appears when it runs.

Read the tips below then indent the code so it looks nice and tidy.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

  <head>
      <title></title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>Puppies and Kittens</h1>
    <p>Here is a cute picture.</p>
    <img src="cute.jpg" alt="A cute puppy and kitten.">
  </body> 
  
</html>
```

## How can you indent ?

One way is to put the cursor at the beggining of a line and press the space bar multiple times. It works but it's considered bad
